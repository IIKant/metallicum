          Our metallurgical plant provides metal and finished metal products to industries 
          such as heavy and precision engineering, the construction industry, and the 
          defense industry. The enterprise has four main metallurgical stages: smelting, 
          rolling, drawing, finishing section. The plant's products occupy a stable position 
          in the market and have established themselves as high-tech and high-quality.

            <h1>3D printer</h1>
            <p>
              3D printers for metal, we use for small-scale production. We recycle the metal powder, after each print, 
              the unused powder is collected and sifted, and then topped up with fresh material to the level required 
              for the next production. Since the cost of metal printing is very high, software simulators are often 
              used to predict how a part will behave during processing. These topology optimization algorithms are 
              used in other ways not only to increase mechanical performance and create lightweight parts.

              The main task of these fasteners is to provide a reliable connection, the ability to assemble and disassemble

              others. A washer is used to protect the surface that is being bolted together.

            <p>
              We produce high-strength bolts from alloy or carbon steel, the carbon content of which does not exceed 0.5%. 
              These components are heat treated in a furnace. We apply the thread on special devices - automatic machines. 
              The manufacture of high-strength bolts is a very relevant process today, because the scope of use of these 
              hardware is large: mechanical engineering, construction, in the construction of railways, in the construction 
              of bridges, and the connection of various structures.

            <h1>Bearing production</h1>
            <p>
              Bearings are technical devices that are part of the bearings of rotating axles and shafts. They perceive the 
              radial and axial loads applied to the shaft or axle and transfer them to the frame, housing or other parts of 
              the structure. At the same time, they must also hold the shaft in space, provide rotation, swing or linear 
              movement with minimal energy loss. The efficiency, performance and durability of the machine largely depend 
              on the quality of the bearings.

        <h2>Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          A new generation high-speed mill and our own transport facilities allow us to produce 
          and deliver products of consistently high quality in a short time.
          Our factory is the first manufacturer of rolled products and an advanced enterprise.
        </p>
        <h2>Trend of our time</h2>
        <p>
          We are convinced that by using scrap metal as a raw material, we are doing the right 
          thing. In the broadest sense. Recycling of raw materials is the main trend of our time. 
          With the right approach, this can reduce the negative burden on nature and reduce the 
          extraction of non-renewable resources. By using scrap metal, we are creating a better 
          future for the entire planet.
        </p>
        <h2>Team</h2>
        <p>
          We appreciate and are proud of everyone who contributes to the common cause. Our people 
          are the most important thing. We can rely on the professionalism of everyone, because 
          only together we can achieve goals and set new ones. And it is right.
